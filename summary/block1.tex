%TODO: Include illustrative example of state representation including input, output, state var rangers and their rates of change as diff eq.

\begin{description}
	\item[Execution Existence] The defining functions are continuous.
	\item[Execution Uniqueness] Lipschitz-continuous, i.e., $\NORM{f(u) - f(v)} <= K \NORM{u - v}$ for some constant $K$.
	\item[Equilibrium] All derivatives are 0 for a given state $x$.
	\item[Lyapunov Stability] For each initial deviation there is a constant bound for all state variables for any future point in time. (Assumption: No inputs)
	\item[Lyapunov Asymptotic Stability] For each deviation within a certain bound the state will converge to the equilibrium again.
	\item[Bounded-Input-Bounded-Output Stability] For every bounded input, the output is bounded
\end{description}
