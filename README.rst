Imagine a city, razed to the ground by an earthquake, a hurricane, or  any other major catastrophe. In the midst of the ruins there is a person, buried in ashes and debris, but alive and crying for help. This is - without any doubt - a case for Iron Man! Unless he is busy. Or too expensive. After all there is a reconstruction pending.  

In this case it sounds like a perfect opportunity for a squad of Tin Bots to come and save the day! With modern infra red surveillance technology they will spot and save the victim in no time. And the best part is: They are incredibly cost efficient and thus affordable for anyone.
